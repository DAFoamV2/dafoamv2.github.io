We will organize an online DAFoam workshop on June 9, 2021, from 9 am to 12 pm EST.

The objective of this workshop is to get you familiar with how to run optimizations with DAFoam. To be more specific, we will go over the OpenFOAM and DAFoam configuration files (e.g., controlDict, fvSchemes, runScript.py) and have a hands-on section that allows you to run OpenFOAM and DAFoam cases. 

If you are interested, please register from [here](https://forms.gle/zc92G9kpQAVGpd6f8). Here we also have a few optional survey questions that can help us better prepare the workshop materials. Once finished, we will send you the workshop Zoom link. 

We are looking forward to seeing you.

Agenda

The workshop will have three sections. Each section has an about 50-minute lecture and discussion with a 10-minute break. The workshop materials are available from [here](https://github.com/DAFoam/workshops). We will cover the following topics:

- DAFoam Introduction
- MACH-Aero Framework
- Airfoil Aerodynamic Optimization
- Wing Aerodynamic Optimization

This workshop has hands-on examples, so we strongly recommend you install [Docker](https://dafoam.github.io/mydoc_get_started_download_docker.html) and [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/download/) before the meeting.
