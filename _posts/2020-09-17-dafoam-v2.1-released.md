DAFoam v2.1.0 is a major update that adds unsteady optimization capability as well as new interfaces and code structures.

- Added the DAPisoFoam for periodic unsteady optimization (https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam/pull/62/commits/709dca5e461b137d397adeb40584beff63470594)

- Implemented an actuator point model for unsteady wakes (https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam/pull/62/commits/64730d10fbede533e64e85b5cd638cc20673ecc6)

- New boundary conditions for the oscillating velocity from far fields (https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam/pull/62/commits/b1d057343f734d8969b800c02aa4217477c0374a)

- New wall function for SA model that has much tighter default tolerance (https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam/pull/62/commits/be10ca4cb578981c94b3aac9265eac0ae0ee0f8c)

- Implemented the SpalartAllmarasFv3, kEpsilon and kOmegaSST models for the adjoint (https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam/pull/62/commits/51073545661ffbd616d02f69b466856b862d7678 https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam/pull/62/commits/cf6b61358c748541784141dd2737cc7dea440155 ).

- Updated the API for the Python layer, the `turbulenceModel` and `flowCondition` are no longer needed (https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam/pull/62/commits/eb2ffe14e556b2b88a0d022aef4c1a55147644a1)

- Re-organized the code structures such that all custom boundary conditions and models are compiled in DASolver.so (https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam/pull/62/commits/f876056b2968a032a827b1518fba4fe25a631649)

- Updated the Travis tests such that they run concurrently (https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam/pull/62/commits/aa3806374104bc501bd48cd341a4f2061d58c198)
