We have developed a ParaView-based GUI to setup and run airfoil aerodynamic optimization with DAFoam. Check out this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mULPOYU7tuk)

We can setup flow conditions and optimization parameters in ParaView and hit a button to run the optimization with real-time post-processing. 

If you want to try this GUI, check [here](https://dafoam.github.io/mydoc_gui_overview.html).
