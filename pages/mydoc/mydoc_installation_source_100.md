This section assumes you want to compile the DAFoam optimization package from the source on a Linux system. If you use the pre-compiled version, skip this section.

**DAFoam** runs on Linux systems and is based on **OpenFOAM-v1812**. You must install OpenFOAM and verify that it is working correctly. You also need to install the 3rd party and **MDOLab** packages before using DAFoam for optimization. Other dependencies include: 

- C/C++ compilers (gcc/g++ or icc/icpc)
  
- Fortran compiler (gfortran or ifort)
  
- MPI software (openmpi, mvapich2, or impi)
  
- Swig
  
- cmake

To compile the documentation, you also need:

- Doxygen 

- Graphviz

- Sphinx 

**NOTE:** Always try to use the system provided C/Fortran compiler and MPI software to compile DAFoam and all its dependencies. 
Using self-built C/Fortran and MPI may cause linking issues

**NOTE:** For **Ubuntu 18.04** users, you need to compile your own OpenMPI since the Ubuntu 18.04 comes with OpenMPI-2.1 which is known to have compatibility issues with the MDOLab packages. Please follow this [page](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=building) and use version OpenMPI-1.10.7. Make sure you compile OpenMPI before the following steps. After it is done, add this to your bashrc file and source it::

     export LD_PRELOAD=/change_this_to_your_compiled_openmpi_lib_path/libmpi.so
  
Note that the above is needed only for Ubuntu 18.04 because we compile our own OpenMPI.

**NOTE:** The following steps assume you use GNU compilers. For Intel compilers, users need to adjust settings in OpenFOAM and PETSc, and use configuration file config/defaults/config.LINUX_INTEL_OPENMPI.mk for each MDOLab repo.

To install the **DAFoam** package:

1. Create a "**OpenFOAM**" folder in your home directory ($HOME). Go into the "OpenFOAM" directory and install **OpenFOAM-v1812** following this website: http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Installation/Linux/OpenFOAM-v1806/Ubuntu **NOTE**: DAFoam does not support long integer, so in OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v1812/etc/bashrc, use 32bit integer (WM_LABEL_SIZE=32), and double precision scalar (WM_PRECISION_OPTION=DP). After the OpenFOAM installation is done, start a new session to install the rest packages; **DO NOT** load the OpenFOAM environment. This is to prevent environmental variable conflict between OpenFOAM and other packages.


2. Create a "**packages**" folder in your home directory. Go into the "packages" directory and install the following 3rd party packages:

- **Anaconda** Python. **NOTE**: Anaconda2-2.4.0 is recommended since the newer version may have libgfortran conflict. Download https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda2-2.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh and run::
  
      chmod 755 Anaconda2-2.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh && ./Anaconda2-2.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh 

  When asked, put $HOME/packages/anaconda2 as the prefix for the installation path. At the end of the installation, reply "yes" to add the anaconda bin path to your bashrc.

- **PETSc v3.6.4**. Download http://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/petsc/release-snapshots/petsc-3.6.4.tar.gz and untar it in the $HOME/packages folder, go into $HOME/packages/petsc-3.6.4, and run::

      sed -i 's/ierr = MPI_Finalize();CHKERRQ(ierr);/\/\/ierr = MPI_Finalize();CHKERRQ(ierr);/g' src/sys/objects/pinit.c

  This will comment out line 1367 in src/sys/objects/pinit.c to prevent Petsc from conflicting with OpenFOAM MPI. After this, run::

      ./configure --with-shared-libraries --download-superlu_dist --download-parmetis --download-metis --with-fortran-interfaces --with-debugging=no --with-scalar-type=real --PETSC_ARCH=real-opt --download-fblaslapack
   
  and after this, run::

       make PETSC_DIR=$HOME/packages/petsc-3.6.4 PETSC_ARCH=real-opt all

  Add the following into your bashrc and source it::

       export PETSC_DIR=$HOME/packages/petsc-3.6.4
       export PETSC_ARCH=real-opt
       export PATH=$PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/bin:$PATH
       export PATH=$PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/include:$PATH
       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/lib
       export PETSC_LIB=$PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/lib

- **cgnslib_3.2.1** (http://cgns.sourceforge.net/download.html). Download cgnslib_3.2.1.tar.gz, put it in the $HOME/packages/ folder, and untar it. NOTE: The 3.2.1 version fortran include file is bad, so you need to manually edit the cgnslib_f.h file in the src directory and remove all the comment lines at the beginning of the file starting with "C". Then run::

       cmake .

  and::

       ccmake .

  A “GUI” appears and toggle ENABLE_FORTRAN by pressing [enter] (should be OFF when entering the screen for the first time, hence set it to ON). Type ‘c’ to reconfigure and ‘g’ to generate and exit. Then run::

       make

  Now add this into your bashrc and source it::

       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/packages/cgnslib_3.2.1/src

- **mpi4py-1.3.1** (http://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py/downloads/). Untar and run::
 
       python setup.py install --user
    
  This will install the package to the .local directory.
  
- **petsc4py-3.6.0** (http://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py/downloads/). Untar and run::
 
       python setup.py install --user
    
  This will install the package to the .local directory.
  


3. Create a "**repos**" folder in your home directory. Go into the "repos" directory and download and install the following **MDOLab** packages (use small cases for all the repository names):

- First add this to your bashrc and source it::
 
        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/repos/
   
- Get **baseClasses**. In the "**repos**" folder, Run::

        git clone https://github.com/mdolab/baseclasses && cd baseclasses && git checkout 298ac94 && cd ../

- Get **pyGeo**. In the "**repos**" folder, Run::

        git clone https://github.com/mdolab/pygeo && cd pygeo && git checkout 90f4b90 && cd ../
 
- Get **openFoamMeshReader**. In the "**repos**" folder, Run::

        git clone https://github.com/mdolab/openfoammeshreader && cd openfoammeshreader && git checkout d53d72d && cd ../

- Get **multipoint**. In the "**repos**" folder, Run::

        git clone https://github.com/mdolab/multipoint && cd multipoint && git checkout 6818887 && cd ../

- Get **pySpline**. In the "**repos**" folder, Run::

        git clone https://github.com/mdolab/pyspline && cd pyspline && git checkout 30f2340 && cd ../
  
  and in the "**pyspline**" folder, run::
   
        cp config/defaults/config.LINUX_GFORTRAN.mk config/config.mk && make
   
- Get **pyHyp**. In the "**repos**" folder, Run::

        git clone https://github.com/mdolab/pyhyp && cd pyhyp && git checkout 926b3f7 && cd ../
  
  and in the "**pyhyp**" folder, run::
   
        cp -r config/defaults/config.LINUX_GFORTRAN_OPENMPI.mk config/config.mk && make

- Get **cgnsUtilities**. In the "**repos**" folder, Run::

        git clone https://github.com/mdolab/cgnsutilities && cd cgnsutilities && git checkout 3430e04 && cd ../
  
  and in the "**cgnsutilities**" folder, run::
   
        cp config.mk.info config.mk && make
     
  Add this to your bashrc and source it::
   
        export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/repos/cgnsutilities/bin
     
- Get **IDWarp**. In the "**repos**" folder, Run::

        git clone https://github.com/mdolab/idwarp && cd idwarp && git checkout 0149681 && cd ../
    
  and in the "**idwarp**" folder, run::
     
        cp -r config/defaults/config.LINUX_GFORTRAN_OPENMPI.mk config/config.mk && make
     
- Get **pyOptSparse**. In the "**repos**" folder, Run::

        git clone https://github.com/mdolab/pyoptsparse && cd pyoptsparse && git checkout 6d2ae0a  && cd ../
    
  and in the "**pyoptsparse**" folder, run::
 
        python setup.py install --user


4. Download **DAFoam**. In the "**repos**" folder, Run::

        git clone https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam
     
   Then, source the OpenFOAM environmental variables and compile ::

        source $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-v1812/etc/bashrc && ./Allwmake
    
   Next, go to $HOME/repos/dafoam/python/reg_tests, download `input.tar.gz <https://github.com/mdolab/dafoam/raw/master/python/reg_tests/input.tar.gz>`_ and untar it. Finally, run the regression test there::
  
        python run_reg_tests.py
    
   The regression tests should take less than 30 minutes. You should see something like::
   
        dafoam buoyantBoussinesqSimpleDAFoam: Success!
        dafoam buoyantSimpleDAFoam: Success!
        dafoam calcDeltaVolPointMat: Success!
        dafoam rhoSimpleCDAFoam: Success!
        dafoam rhoSimpleDAFoam: Success!
        dafoam simpleDAFoam: Success!
        dafoam simpleTDAFoam: Success!
        dafoam solidDisplacementDAFoam: Success!
        dafoam turboDAFoam: Success!
  
   You should see the first "Success" in less than 5 minute. If any of these tests fails or they take more than 30 minutes, check the error in the generated dafoam_reg_* files. Make sure all the tests pass before running DAFoam. **NOTE:** The regression tests verify the latest version of DAFoam on Github. However, we use specific old versions for DAFoam's dependencies (e.g., pyGeo, IDWarp).
